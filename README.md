## Hi there 👋
- 📊 I'm currently working on a simple online calculator that takes into account commuting time and overtime in the net salary calculation
- 🏗 I'm also in the process of writing my master's thesis on the design of civil defense facilities

I spend my free time at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, traveling 🌍 or meeting with friends (both in person 🍻 and in game 🎮)
